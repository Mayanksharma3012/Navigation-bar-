# Responsive Navigation Bar 🌐

A clean and modern navigation bar built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project was created as part of my web development learning journey.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple website header with:
- Brand name on the left
- Navigation links (Home, About, Services, Contact)
- Call-to-action button ("Get Started")

The design was inspired by a tutorial, and I customized the layout, colors, and styling to better understand how HTML structure and CSS styling work together.
